# Rice varieties detector
## Dataset Content
* Describe your dataset. Choose a dataset of reasonable size to avoid exceeding the repository's maximum size and to have a shorter model training time. If you are doing an image recognition project, we suggest you consider using an image shape that is 100px × 100px or 50px × 50px, to ensure the model meets the performance requirement but is smaller than 100Mb for a smoother push to GitHub. A reasonably sized image set is ~5000 images, but you can choose ~10000 lines for numeric or textual data. 


## Business Requirements
Our client, a leading agricultural company specializing in rice production, has approached us with a unique challenge. They require a Machine Learning (ML) based solution to accurately classify rice grains into five specific varieties: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag. The need for this technology stems from the fact that these rice varieties, while visually similar, have significant differences in cooking properties and market value. Accurate classification is crucial for maintaining the quality and reputation of their products.  Here you can familiarize yourself with the full [business interview](https://github.com/1101712/Rice-Detector/wiki/Business-understanding-interview)

Summarizing:  

 1. The client is keen on conducting an in-depth analysis to visually differentiate between the five rice varieties. This involves identifying unique features of each variety through machine learning techniques.  

2. The primary goal is to develop an ML model capable of determining the specific variety of rice depicted in uploaded images. This model should be highly accurate (over 95%) and efficient, given the close resemblance between the rice varieties.  

 3. Another essential requirement is the ability to generate detailed prediction reports. These reports will provide insights into the classification results for each uploaded image, aiding in quality control and product categorization.

4. Considering the vast amount of rice grains processed daily, the solution must be scalable and adaptable to handle large datasets without compromising accuracy or performance.

5. The client has emphasized the need for a user-friendly interface that allows for easy uploading of rice images and retrieval of prediction reports. 


## Hypothesis and validation
**Hypothesis 1**: Distinctive Features in Rice Varieties  

Hypothesis: On the images of five rice varieties (Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag) provided for study by the client, distinct distinguishing features can be identified.

- How to Validate: To confirm this hypothesis, a thorough analysis of the rice varieties' images will be conducted. This will involve using image processing and deep learning techniques to identify unique features such as shape, size, texture, and color that differentiate each variety. Machine learning models will be trained and tested on these images to assess their ability to recognize and distinguish these features accurately.

**Hypothesis 2**: High Accuracy with Large Datasets and Deep Learning  

Hypothesis: With a sufficiently large dataset, the use of deep learning and carefully prepared data can achieve high accuracy (over 95%) in classifying the five rice varieties (Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag) in images.

- How to Validate: This hypothesis will be validated by assembling a large dataset of images representing the five rice varieties. The dataset will undergo preprocessing to ensure optimal quality and uniformity. A deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), will then be trained on this dataset. The model's performance will be evaluated based on its accuracy in correctly classifying the images into the respective rice varieties. The goal is to achieve an accuracy rate of over 95%, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in handling complex image classification tasks.



## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
The five main business requirements were split in several user stories which were translated in Machine Learning Tasks.  For a more detailed exploration of the user stories and their associated tasks and acceptance criteria see [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/1101712/projects/8/views/1). 
All the tasks were manually tested and function as expected.


## ML Business Case
For a comprehensive overview and detailed insights,plwase explore our Project Handbook on the  [Wiki](https://github.com/1101712/Rice-Detector/wiki/Rice-Varieties-Detector-Handbook).

### Rice Varieties Classifier  
Our goal is to develop an ML model that accurately classifies rice grains into one of five varieties – Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag – based on an extensive image dataset. This project is a classic case of supervised learning, framed as a multi-class, single-label classification challenge.

The ideal outcome of this project is to provide an efficient and reliable tool for accurate rice variety identification, which is crucial for quality control in the agricultural and food industries.

The success metrics for our model include:

An accuracy rate exceeding 95% on the test dataset.
The model output is designed to classify the rice variety and provide the associated probability for each classification. Users can upload rice grain images to the application, with instant, on-the-spot predictions.
Heuristics: Traditional methods of rice variety identification rely on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and subject to human error. This project aims to automate and enhance the accuracy of this process.

The training data for the model are sourced from a curated dataset of rice grain images, encompassing a wide variety of rice types and characteristics. This dataset is critical for training the model to recognize and differentiate between the specified rice varieties accurately.

## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
