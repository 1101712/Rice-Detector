It includes the distribution of image labels across the training, validation, and test sets, as well as a summary of the model's predictive accuracy, ensuring the model's robustness in distinguishing between rice and non-rice images.

    The pie chart breaks down the dataset into training, validation, and test sets by percentage, showing us the proportion of images used for each phase of the model's development.

    Train set (70% of the whole dataset) is the initial data used to 'fit' the model which will learn on this set how to generalize and make prediction on new unseen data.

    Validation set (10% of the dataset) helps to improve the model performance by fine-tuning the model after each epoch (one complete pass of the training set through the model).

    The test set (20% of the dataset) informs us about the final accuracy of the model after completing the training phase. It's a batch of data the model has never seen.

    This line chart tracks the model's accuracy and loss at each epoch during training. A declining loss and rising accuracy indicate the model's improving performance over time.
    Loss represents the cumulative mistakes the model makes for each example during the training (referred to as 'loss') and validation phases (referred to as 'val_loss').

The value of loss indicates the model's performance after every optimization cycle â€” a lower loss suggests better performance.

Accuracy measures the precision of the model's predictions ('accuracy') against the actual outcomes ('val_accuracy').

A well-performing model on new, unseen data demonstrates its ability to generalize, indicating that it has learned the underlying patterns rather than just memorizing the training data.
